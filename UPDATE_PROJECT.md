# Project Update Instructions

## Files to Add to Xcode Project

The following files need to be added to your Xcode project:

### Engine Files (Add to Engine group):
1. `Engine/src/HTMLParser.swift`
2. `Engine/src/CSSParser.swift`
3. `Engine/src/RenderingEngine.swift`

### App Files (Add to App/Sources group):
1. `App/Sources/CustomWebView.swift`

## How to Add Files in Xcode:

1. Open `PrivateBrowser.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Right-click on the "Engine" folder in the project navigator
3. Select "Add Files to 'PrivateBrowser'..."
4. Navigate to Engine/src/ and select all three Swift files
5. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is unchecked (files are already in place)
6. Make sure "Add to targets: PrivateBrowser" is checked
7. Click "Add"

8. Right-click on the "Sources" folder under "App" in the project navigator
9. Select "Add Files to 'PrivateBrowser'..."
10. Navigate to App/Sources/ and select `CustomWebView.swift`
11. Make sure "Add to targets: PrivateBrowser" is checked
12. Click "Add"

## Build and Run:

1. Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K)
2. Build the project: Product → Build (⌘B)
3. Run on your device: Product → Run (⌘R)

## What This Provides:

- **Custom HTML Parser**: Parses HTML into a DOM tree without WebKit
- **CSS Parser**: Handles styling and layout rules
- **Rendering Engine**: Converts DOM + CSS into native UIViews
- **No WebKit**: Completely bypasses Apple's WebKit and Screen Time restrictions
- **Direct Rendering**: Uses UIKit views and Core Graphics for display

## Current Capabilities:

✅ HTML parsing and DOM tree creation
✅ CSS parsing and style computation
✅ Basic layout engine (block and inline elements)
✅ Text rendering with fonts and colors
✅ Link handling and navigation
✅ Image loading and display
✅ Scrollable content
✅ No Screen Time restrictions

## Limitations:

- No JavaScript execution yet
- Limited CSS support (basic properties only)
- Simple layout algorithm (no flexbox/grid yet)
- No form input handling yet
- No video/audio support yet

## Next Steps:

To add JavaScript support, we would need to integrate JavaScriptCore or V8 engine.
